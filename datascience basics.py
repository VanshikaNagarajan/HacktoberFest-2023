A data is a set of characters, numbers, symbols which are stored.

Information refers to the data which is useful to a person.

— Railway station. Let’s say your train name is Rajdhani Express 12344 moving from Delhi to Mumbai.

The upcoming train names and train numbers on the screens at the platform can be classified as data whereas your train name and number becomes useful for you so it can be called information.

Data turns into information with respect to your needs and interests.

Now, let us understand what is Data Science actually!

Data Science is simply Data + Science in the real world. As you are now familiar with the word data, let’s move on to the term Science. SCIENCE means a study.
Study on any observations in the world be it objects, people, flora fauna, galaxy and so on. To study anything you want something for reference right! Here comes the data in action.
Data and Science holding hand in hand helps in business decisions like figuring out which items on an ecommerce website need what type of discount and how much sales projection will be and what are the users interests in the past season.
Why is Data Science important?

Data Science helps in decision-making throughout the organisation. Awareness about a particular topic, helps you to know what could be transformed into information and help to grow your organisation and what hasn’t been working.
A Data Scientist observes, manages and manipulates the data to improve decision-making. Without data science we wouldn’t be able to do simple things like how much cake to bake the next day in a bakery given the season, festival, occasions, & similar other statistics — if you create more of a product it may go stale & its value goes down, if your output is less instead it hurts the business in revenue & missed potential. So to make such informed decisions data science plays a key role! A bakery owner can do all this intuitively based on simple bookkeeping, but in technologically driven organisations this is done using statistics, machine learning & Ai.
Helps in productive modelling, forecasting, big data. Oops! A lot of new terms appeared. Looks like we need to check on them.
Forecasting helps in the process of prediction based on the past and the present data they have. For instance, a Hotel is merged with an Airline, forecasting helps to predict how many passengers are interested to avail the same hotel that the airline is merged with.
But how is productive modelling related to this?
Productive modelling, helps to predict in a more minute format. Taking the above example in reference, productive modelling will further help to predict how many passengers are likely to avail a suite in the hotel.

6. Big data is a large set of data that can’t be processed on a single machine/computer/server — like a big social network like Instagram has to distribute this data into several servers acting as one data processing unit to calculate things like social connections (recommending new friends), user’s like, dislikes, news feed & search page recommendations that are personal to the user, & what posts to show.
Use of Data Science happens in all sort of teams and organisations. In launching tangible technology delivering the product directly to the customers managing sole ownership of product creation like Apple, or in a service oriented team managing product creation on other’s behalf like TCS.

Some of the examples of a product-based and service based Companies:

Product-based — Amazon, Google, Ola, Myntra, Uber, Intel, Samsung.

Service-based — Deloitte, HCL, TCS.

#Domains that widely use Data Science:

Social Media, Medical field, Sports, Search Engines, Restaurants, Airlines.
Data collection — Retrieving data from the resources. Resources could be any database, API’s, surveys, sensor data.

Data preprocessing — This means, preparing the data for data analysis. This includes data cleaning, finding the missing values, altering the data, normalising the data, encoding variable to numeric numbers, and to deal with outliers.

Data analysis — To find the statistical value of the data i.e; mean, mode, median. Also, plotting the historical plot, box plot and scatter plots.

Data visualisation — This includes bar charts, line plots, heat maps.

Data Types!
There are many data types, but I am keeping it till the beginner needs. So there are two which one should know when they are starting with data science, that is categorical data and numerical data. Categorical data is further divided into Nominal data and Ordinal data.

CATEGORICAL DATA — From the word ‘category’ you can understand that categorical means the data could be identified by labels.

Now, what does Nominal Data means?

NOMINAL DATA represents labels with no ‘inherent order’ in them. Like, yes or no, types of animals etc. These do not depend upon the earlier stage of the data.

But, ORDINAL DATA does depend upon the stage of the earlier data. They do have ‘inherent order’ within them. Example, like school data (Junior, Senior), (Poor, Good, Average, Excellent).

NUMERICAL DATA — This just simply plays with numeric values, which could be an integer, float, double etc. But this also has two types such as discrete and continuous.

DISCRETE here means, having distinct values i.e; being in a noticeable gap and CONTINUOUS means any numeric values being in the boundaries of the precision.

That’s all with the Game of Data!

But, still it’s not over yet! As, Data Science is a vast domain. There is a lot to do!

Why is Pipelining important?

Data pipelining simply refers to cleaning and modifying right!! Yes so Data Preprocessing and Data Cleaning helps to improve the quality of data which then gets ease for data mining.

So, it helps to get the best accuracy of any statistical value or model value. It helps cut out the noise & focus on attributes that are important.

Now if you have an end semester examination and you are given the whole syllabus to cover. But, you still find out important topics that would have more weightage and focus in the exam.

Similarly! For a better result Data preprocessing and Data cleaning is very important.
